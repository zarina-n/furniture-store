# Interior - Furniture Store (Mock Data)

**Interior** is a mock furniture e-commerce website built for demonstration and learning purposes. This project simulates a functional online furniture store, but all data (products, user accounts, orders, etc.) are mocked. There are no actual purchases or inventory updates ‚Äî everything is designed to showcase the front-end, authentication, and shopping features.

The project is still under development, and you can track the progress through the detailed checklist in the [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md) file.

## Website URL

[theinterior.site](https://theinterior.site) _(Note: Data is mocked and not functional for real purchases.)_

## üîí Authentication

The website uses **Kinde** for authentication, enabling users to sign in using the following methods:

- **Google Login**: Authentication via Google accounts (for demo purposes only).
- **Email + Password Login**: Traditional sign-in method, using mocked user data.

### Guest Checkout

Users who are not signed in can still proceed with **guest checkout**. This is for demonstration purposes only and does not process any actual orders.

### Favorites (Private Route)

Users must be signed in to add items to their **Favorites**. Favorites are saved in a mock database and don't persist across real sessions.
